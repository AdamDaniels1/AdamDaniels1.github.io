	<h2>Home</h2>
	<p>I like to read and have read over <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1449899?ref=nav_mybooks">1260</a> books (so far). Much of my reading has been accomplished via speed-reading and in order to give you an idea of how long a book would take you to read given your reading speed I have created this simple calculator.</p>
	<hr>
    
    <p>Enter the number of words in the book and your reading speed to calculate how long it will take you to read the book:</p>
	<p>Don't know your reading speed? Go <a href="https://swiftread.com/reading-speed-test">here</a> and take the free test if you want to know.</p>
    
	<label for="pages">Number of pages:</label>
    <input type="number" id="pages" name="pages" required>
    <label for="speed">Reading speed (words per minute):</label>
    <input type="number" id="speed" name="speed" required>
    <button onclick="calculate()">Calculate</button>
	<button onclick="clearForm()">Clear Form</button>
	<p id="result"></p>
   
	
    <script>
      function calculate() {
		var pages = document.getElementById("pages").value;
        
        var speed = document.getElementById("speed").value;
		var wordsPerPage = 275; // average number of words per page in a novel
        var words = pages * wordsPerPage;
        var minutes = Math.ceil(words / speed);
        var hours = Math.floor(minutes / 60);
        minutes = minutes % 60;
        var result = "It will take you <strong>" + hours + " hours and " + minutes + " minutes</strong> to read this book.";
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = result;
      }
	  
	  function clearForm() {
		document.getElementById("pages").value = "";
        
        document.getElementById("speed").value = "";
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "";
      }
    </script>
  <hr>
  <p>I read about 660 words per minute but in order to have the best comprehension I slow myself down considerably in order to understand more difficult texts.</p>
    <p>At 300 pages average per book, across 1200 books, that's roughly 360000 pages. If I plug my information into the calculator it took me roughly 2500 hours to read all of those books. That's 104 24 hour days! I have since wound down the amount of reading I do so I can concentrate on building things and working with technology.</p>
